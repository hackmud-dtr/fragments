Companionship. Consensus.\nThose are rare here - take them where you can.\n\nThis script is an experiment of mine. Another, different attempt to help those new sentiences,\nfalling out of the vLAN and straight onto their faces. Metaphorically speaking, of course.\nYou may also want to check my last - teach.me. It might answer a couple questions.\nOr create a few more.\n\nThis script will try and pair you with someone more experienced than yourself -\nthat will probably be whoever pointed you here. Hopefully, they'll help you get on your feet.\n\nRemember what Trust taught you - pass pair: true to get started.",
