In addition to telling you the access and security level of the scriptor you wish to `Ncheck`, it measures the (approximate) length and time that script took to parse, giving you an estimate of complexity and dependencies. Please note that this time and length includes that of abandoned_xb895b.alasil itself - we recommend first running abandoned_xb895b.alasil against itself or an empty script to establish a baseline.\\n\\nIf given a script to `Nrun` and a level you consider `Nsafe`, it will also assess the target script for database usage and weakness to a selection of known attacks. Some attacks are given CODENAMES, to prevent the disclosure of trade secrets. Additional arguments other than those used by abandoned_xb895b.alasil will be passed to the script being `Nrun`.\\n\\nA note on DB impact: an impact of 0 does not neccessarily mean the target script did not write to their database. You may still be being logged. Not all DB usages can currently be tracked, unfortunately.\\n\\nabandoned_xb895b.alasil takes some steps to mask its use. It will disguise itself as a randomly generated script name, or you may specify a name you wish to `Nspoof` it as.\"}",
