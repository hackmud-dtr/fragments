	"pl_output": "Comprehensive NPC opener\nUsage: /open npc.loc, where:\n\n  For `3T1 NPCs`:\n/open = palladium.open {{ N:\"{0}\", T:#s.{0} }}\n  For `JSome T2 NPCs`:\n/open = palladium.open {{ N:\"{0}\", T:#s.{0}, j:#s.accts.transactions, b:#s.accts.balance, h:#s.your_alt.bank }}\n\nNotes on `3dependency injection`:\nThis top level script is `2FULLSEC`, and always will be. Any functionality that requires less sandboxing is optional, and will only ever be passed in as a script reference.\n\nInterfaces for injected scripts (that you should provide) are as follows:\n\n`Nj`:#s.accts.transactions\nThis is used to break the T2 `Jacct_nt` lock, whose solution is the net GC transferred between two lock supplied timestamps.\nThis should roughly mimic the interface of accts.transactions. This script should return an object containing a field `Ntransactions`, which is an array of objects that each contain the fields `Ntime` and `Namount`.\naccts.transactions itself will work fine, but you can supply a wrapper that strips out the information not mentioned above if you wish.\n\n`Nb`:#s.accts.balance\nThis is used to break the T2 `Jglock` lock, whose solution requires that you have exactly the GC balance required to answer the lock supplied question.\nThis should mimic the interface of accts.balance.\naccts.balance itself will work fine.\n\n`Nh`:#s.your_alt.bank { get: number, put: number }\nThis is used to break the T2 `Jglock` lock, whose solution requires that you have exactly the GC balance required to answer the lock supplied question.\nThis script should be supplied by your alt account, and allow to transfer GC to and from it.\n`Nget` is the amount that should be transferred from your alt account to your infiltration account. Use #fs.`Faccts`.`Lxfer_gc_to_caller`, remembering to condition this on a check that the caller is one of your accounts!\n`Nput` is the amount that should be transferred from your infiltration account to your alt account, and may be `Vall`. Use #ms.`Faccts`.`Lxfer_gc_to` - you probably want to hardcode the name of your alt account as the destination.\nIn general, if the target NPC script is at a security level where a `Jglock` is possible, the top level script will use `Vb` and `Vh` to transfer your entire current balance to your alt, retrieve exactly the amounts required to break the lock (which should not be more than a few K GC), and restore the original balance after the script has finished executing.\nIf a `Jglock` encounter is possible, but no `Vb` or `Vh` dependencies were supplied, the top-level script will report this situation and refuse to continue. As otherwise, it could result in the loss of a very large amount of GC to the NPC's lock.\n\n\n\n`LImplementation status`:\n - `3T1 NPCs`: `LFully supported`\n - `JT2 NPCs`: `5partially supported`.\n - `5T3 NPCs and above`: `Dnot yet supported`",
